A lot of this library you will be creating will require intuitive folder and file inputs
for it to be used with ease by other developers

So it is important to keep consistent track of pointers and whatnot

There should be a save site for the web scraping of CHOPCHOP outputs since
webscraping takes a long time for one gene. Right now make the chopchop/temp
folder the host for all guideRNA output regarding organisms and genes.

chopchop/temp/organism/gene shall contain the entire guide_rnas output info
that can be read quickly by future knockout scripts without constantly doing
web scraping

You've saved the off targets but the next thing to do is save all the CHOPCHOP
output data into the guide_rna_results_storage_folder so that you don't need
to go through hundreds of pages for each gene knockout. Also keep a date when it
is run so that we can give a rule where if the results are 3 months old we must
do the webscraping again

You want to be able to save a run where the unique attributes are organism
and gene target.

Have one summary file called output_summary.txt that displays

Date Run: <Insert Date Run Here>
