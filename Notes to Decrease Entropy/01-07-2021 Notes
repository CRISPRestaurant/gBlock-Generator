At this point you have created a first algorithm to successfully get primers all the time,
the problem is the lengths when the SbfI digest is done is not different enough to show
significant visual difference on a gel.

Now we need a new algorithm such that as the degree of asymmetry inputted increases the
separation on the gel increases as well.

Arguments proposed:

- Degree of Asymmetry (DOA)
- Approximate minimum space length between restriction site and left primer search space or right primer search space,
  depending on which is the minimum, this is only for the first amplicon combination (MSL - minimum spacing length)
- Length of both left primer search space and right primer search space (not left primer search space +
  right primer search space but left primer search space = right primer search space) (PSSL - primer search space length)
- Maximum length of the amplicon (MAL - maximum amplicon length)

If # of base pairs right of the restriction digest is smaller than # of base pairs left of the restriction digest,
do Case #1

If # of base pairs left of the restriction digest is smaller than # of base pairs right of the restriction digest,
do Case #2

Case #1:

1. Design the first amplicon combination
1a. Have the PSSL bp right primer search space be MSL bp away from the restriction digest region
1b. Have the PSSL bp left primer search space be MSL * DOA bp away from the restriction digest region
1c. Note the probability of finding a 20 bp primer in the optimal GC range

2. Design the rest amplicon combinations
2a. Shift the PSSL bp right primer search space 1 bp to the right
2b. Shift the PSSL bp left primer search space DOA bp to the left
2c. Note the probability of finding a 20 bp primer in the optimal GC range (to save time keep note of the
number of optimal primers and the total number of possible primers, and then just determine which optimal primers
are lost moving away from them and which optimal primers are gained by moving towards them)

3. Repeat Step 2 until the amplicon length exceeds MAL, do not include this exceeded amplicon length into determination
of optimal amplicon

4. Find the optimal amplicon from the max probability value

5. Use this to obtain primers and once you obtain the primers get the lengths of the DNA after Sbf1 digest

Case #2:

1. Design the first amplicon combination
1a. Have the PSSL bp left primer search space be MSL bp away from the restriction digest region
1b. Have the PSSL bp right primer search space be MSL * DOA bp away from the restriction digest region
1c. Note the probability of finding a 20 bp primer in the optimal GC range

2. Design the rest amplicon combinations
2a. Shift the PSSL bp left primer search space 1 bp to the left
2b. Shift the PSSL bp right primer search space DOA bp to the right
2c. Note the probability of finding a 20 bp primer in the optimal GC range (to save time keep note of the
number of optimal primers and the total number of possible primers, and then just determine which optimal primers
are lost moving away from them and which optimal primers are gained by moving towards them)

3. Repeat Step 2 until the amplicon length exceeds MAL, do not include this exceeded amplicon length into determination
of optimal amplicon

4. Find the optimal amplicon from the max probability value

5. Use this to obtain primers and once you obtain the primers get the lengths of the DNA after Sbf1 digest
