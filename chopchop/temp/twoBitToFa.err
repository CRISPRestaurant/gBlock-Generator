twoBitToFa - Convert all or part of .2bit file to fasta
usage:
   twoBitToFa input.2bit output.fa
options:
   -seq=name - restrict this to just one sequence
   -start=X  - start at given position in sequence (zero-based)
   -end=X - end at given position in sequence (non-inclusive)
   -seqList=file - file containing list of the desired sequence names 
                    in the format seqSpec[:start-end], e.g. chr1 or chr1:0-189
                    where coordinates are half-open zero-based, i.e. [start,end)
   -noMask - convert sequence to all upper case
   -bpt=index.bpt - use bpt index instead of built in one
   -bed=input.bed - grab sequences specified by input.bed. Will exclude introns
   -bedPos        - with -bed, to use chrom:start-end as the fasta ID in output.fa

Sequence and range may also be specified as part of the input
file name using the syntax:
      /path/input.2bit:name
   or
      /path/input.2bit:name
   or
      /path/input.2bit:name:start-end
